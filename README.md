# Swarm_Synthesizer

This code was written by Cyrill Studer and Lazar Jeremic during a workshop at the The Basel School of Design in 2014. The program was originally intended to be a visual synthesizer to be performed to the track Lost & Found by Amon Tobin using a self-made Arduino controller. Got here to see the project documentation > https://www.behance.net/gallery/14450245/Swarm-Synthesizer-Visual-Performance

This version is altered to be controlled by a Korg nanoKONTROL2.
